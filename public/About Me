    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        Hi, I’m Lia — a 26-year-old developer and nature lover living in sunny San Diego. I’m currently learning full-stack development and enjoying the process of building clean, functional websites from scratch. I really like solving problems and finding creative ways to bring ideas to life with code. This project is a small reflection of everything I’ve been learning along the way.
    </p>

        When I’m not coding, I love spending time outside — trail running, collecting shells at the beach, painting, or going on long walks with my dog Barbosa, who’s always trying to spot a lizard. I also have two cats, Grover and Lua, who keep me company during quiet moments at home. I’m a Scorpio, which I think shows up in how curious and focused I get when I’m excited about something new (like learning to code).
    </p>

        Some of my favorite days start with breakfast at my go-to diner, a stop for vegan doughnuts, and time with my husband and family. I try to bring a mix of creativity, calm, and curiosity into everything I make — whether I’m sketching out a project idea or figuring out how to solve a bug. I’m excited to keep learning and building as I grow in this space.
